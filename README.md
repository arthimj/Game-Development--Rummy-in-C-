It is you versus the computer. User (you) goes first; this alternates each hand. Players earn points by melding cards from their hand into the meld area. Players may meld a set of cards once they have at least 3 of a kind. Each turns starts with picking up a card, and ends by discarding a card. The hand continues .If both players end with same points, player with more points wins. If you want the first card from your hand you would enter 0. If choosing multiple cards use one space between numbers. The first letter or number is the rank and after the dash is the suit of the card. When melding cards, always tell which cards you want to meld from your hand in decreasing location order. And when telling the computer these meld spots, terminate your entries with a "-1‚Äù.
